# AnonChat

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `iex -S mix phoenix.server`
  * If you want to look at processes as well, then use `:observer.start()`. Look at 'applications', 'anon chat', then find the name of the process e.g.chat history

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.


Future improvements:
  -add new rooms dynamically (create room button, will spin up a new room with a new route? who knows)
